	    <div>About Ravenloft</div><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">Curse of Strahd</span>
	    is a gothic horror campaign set in Ravenloft, a demiplane of the shadow realm, also known 
	    as the Shadowfell. Here, Strahd resides, ruling over his domain. 
	    An oppressive sorrow hangs over the denizen's of this realm, their
	    tired faces sapped of hopes and ambitions, as they live out their 
	    days, trapped by the mists, in a land where the sun has ceased to rise.

	    <div>Dungeon Master</div><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">Featuring Cordial</span>
	    as the dungeon master, this campaign has high ambitions for intense melodrama
	    and detailed character interaction. With over a year of consistent experience in this role, 
	    this will be her first take at a published horror campaign. She hopes
	    to encourage dynamicy, character development, and complex inter-PC and
	    inter-NPC relationships. When she finishes getting experience running this
	    horrific module, she plans to run it semi-professionally.
